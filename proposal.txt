Homepage
All pages will have a banner at the top which contains navigation information.
Home, completed projects, ongoing projects, discussion forum
Login information (current user, log out, similar to Facebook)



The home page will contain a list of currently active projects (maybe a banner with a rotation of projects, similar to wordpress or Steam)
	Contains a “What's hot” item—what most people are currently contributing to

Two sections of the page: Ongoing and Completed. There will be ways to search both types of project. 



When users log in to the site, activity feed shows up. The activity feed shows activity in projects you've marked or have contributed to.

Users will translate a marked line on an image of the original raw file. These translations will be aggregated and placed in a list for people to vote on the best translation. Each page will be viewed separately with a discussion area (real-time chat) where people can discuss the reason behind choosing one translation over another. The scoring system will be an upvote/downvote idea
